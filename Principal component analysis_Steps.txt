Step1: Get tha data set 
Step2: Eleminate Catagorical attribute from the data set 
Step3: Analyse the data 
step4: Create 5 point plot for better understanding 
Step5: Calculate mean for every attribute 
Step6: Calculate variance and standered deviation for each attribute 
Step7: Calculate zero means unit variance matrix 
Step8: Calculate the corelation between attributes 
Step9: Calculate eigen values  from covariance matrix 
Step10: Sort in decending order and take first n number of values(which contribute more in pca) 
Step11: Find out the eigen vectors  from covariance matrix 
Step12: multiply covariance matrix with the main matrix
Step13: Plot the graph for visualization
